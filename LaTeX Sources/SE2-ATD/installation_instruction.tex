\section{Installation Instruction}

We followed all the instructions given in the ITD.
The group provided a complete set of instructions to setup the DB, populate it and to run the application. It was also defined how to setup the DB for the tests and run them.

To develop the project it was necessary to install python with different libraries and PHP along with Composer (a packet manager for PHP) and Symfony (a PHP framework), because we develop our project using a completely different set programming languages and frameworks.
